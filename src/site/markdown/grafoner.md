*We had a todo-list, which helped us to divide the tasks*\

**The following tasks are those, I was involved in:**

---
- [x] Reading the instructions
- [x] Create repository
- [x] Integrate the template for Drink
- [x] Update pom.xml with my developer-informations
- [x] Error detection/correction in own branch
- [x] Implementation of methods in the Queue-classes
- [x] Created tests for the Queue-classes
- [x] Created Javadoc comments for the methods I implemented
- [x] Created Javadoc comments for the test-methods I implemented
- [x] Maven-Site* including updating creating folder-structure, site.xml, update pom.xml
- [x] Check commit-history
- [x] Check repository

*Note: Maven site didn't quite work for me unfortunately. It worked perfectly for my co-workers.

... as well as "default" actions like branch-merge, updating the [Tasklist](README.md), keeping my co-workers up to date, etc.
