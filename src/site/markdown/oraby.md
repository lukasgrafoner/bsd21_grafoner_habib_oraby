# Planning the project
## We had a to-do list, which helped us to divide the tasks
### The following tasks, are those, where I was involved in:

- [x] Reading the instructions

The whole group had to read the instructions, after everyone seperetally read, we discussed the tasks, which were unclear for some or to make sure that everyone knows what to do. As a result, I managed to create a tasklist in the readme.md [README](README.md).

- [x] pom.xml

Every developer had to add his information to the project.

- [x] 3 Errors

We found the 3 errors together through communicating via teams-videocall.

- [x] Making a branch for fixing the errors

I made a branch called errors

- [x] Branch merge

Eventually I merged this branch (errors) to the main branch.

- [x] New implementation

We all had to implement the given queue

- [x] New queue version

Next, we made a new version of the queue with string and double.

- [x] Creating tests with JUnit

Everyone had to test some methods and merge his version to the main at the end, as every developer had his own branch of implementing.

- [x] Javadoc

I added JavaDoc comments to the other classes, as they were not commented before.

- [x] Javadoc comments for the tests

Every developer had to add JavaDoc comments to his implementations and tests.

- [x] Maven site

After editing the pom.xml and pushing the new version, I created oraby.md in the branch maven_site folder in the right structure.

- [x] Controlling the history

I controlled the history and checked if there are any conflicts.

- [x] Controlling the ripository

At the end, I controlled the ripository on github to detect any errors or conflicts. As a result, the project was ready to be handed in.
